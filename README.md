## Synopsis

Asymptote is a powerful C-based Vector Graphics Language that can be integrated into LaTeX documents. This package adds syntax highlighting functionality to Atom, a text editor. Other features such as automatic compile are planned, but not yet implemented.

Here are an example of the syntax highlighter in action:

The official website of Asymptote is at http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/.

## Motivation

The idea for Asymptote syntax highlighter was conceived during one of my study sessions. I was working for an assignment for Honours Calculus 2, and I needed a way to draw images digitally on LaTeX files since my drawing skills weren't good. So, I discovered Asymptote, which is a powerful vector graphics language (which I found easier to use than TikZ), however there weren't any language packages for Atom at the moment, and I found that managing asy documents is difficult due to lack of keyword emphasizing. So I've developed this package to help mitigate this difficulty.

## Installation

First of all, Atom is necessary for Installation. To install, clone this repository and copy the contents to %userprofile%/.atom/packages/language-asymptote. Restart Atom and all .asy files should be highlighted.

In case of a new asymptote version, new grammar files can be generated by running ```./generate_asy_grammar.sh``` on macOS/Linux or ```generate_asy_grammar.ps1``` on Windows machines. The new ```asymptote.cson``` will be generated in the correct directory. In case of a bug or error with the new file, a backup version is provided with ```asymptote.cson.old```. Simply rename the file to ```asymptote.cson``` to revert back to the manually generated version.

## Contributors

Apart from me, John Bowman helped with Asymptote keywords and grammar generation.
